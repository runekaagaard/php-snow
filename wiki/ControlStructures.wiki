#summary Description of the different control structures in Snow

<wiki:toc/>

= Conditionals =

== `if` ==
The `if` controlstructure follows the basic pattern of:
{{{
if <expr>
    statement
}}}

Where `<expr>` can be any statement that gets evaluated to a boolean. The codeblock `statement` gets executed when `<expr>` evaluates to `true`.

== `if` shorthand ==
`if` can also be abbreviated to the form:
{{{
if <expr>: statement
}}}
This way only one statement is allowed (no code block) and the `:` (colon) is mandatory.

== `elif` / `else` ==
_Elseif/else_ construct. Follows the form:
{{{
if <expr>
    statement
elif <expr2>
    statement2
else
    statement3
}}}

The elif-part can be infinitely repeated and gets evaluated only when `<expr>` evaluates to false.
The else block is the last resort, when no `if` or `elif` evaluates to true.

== `switch` ==
The `switch` statement is like a bunch `if`/`elif` statements. It's basic form is:
{{{
switch <expr>
    case 0
        statement
    case 1
        statement
    default
        statement
}}}
Note that a `break` statement is not necessary. It is the standard. In fact, the keyword is unsupported.
We now have the `fallthru` keyword, it's effect is exactly the opposite of `break`.

Instead of specifying where to stop evaluation of the following statements, you tell the parser explicitly to 'fall through' to the next `case`.

{{{
# Example #1:
a = 1
switch a
    case 0
        echo 0
    case 1
        echo 1
    case 2
        echo 2
# prints: 1
}}}
{{{
# Example #2:
a = 1
switch a
    case 0
        echo 0
        fallthru
    case 1
        echo 1
        fallthru
    case 2
        echo 2
        fallthru
# prints: 12
}}}
