== States ==
OK how to lex Snow? First lets consider the states.

 * Snow: Basic snow code.
 * Single quoted string
 * Double quoted string
 * Triple single quoted string
 * Triple double quoted string
 * Inline html
 * Inside `()`
 * Inside `[]`
 
== Indentation / Whitespace ==
Before lexing all lines ending with a single \ should have the next line
appended to it.

The following keywords forces an indentation on the following line. The use 
thereafter of ':' in the same line cancels that indentation.

 * if
 * else
 * elif
 * for
 * switch
 * case
 * default
 * fn
 * class
 * con / pub / pro / pri / sta
 * while

Some keywords are more special and _can_ trigger an indentation.

 * ??
 * ?!
 
Whitespace works differently when inside `()` or `[]`.
