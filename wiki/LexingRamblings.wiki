== States ==
OK how to lex Snow? First lets consider the states.

 * snow: Default state.
 * Single singlequotes: `'inside'`
 * Single doublequotes: `"inside"`
 * Triple singlequotes: `'''inside'''`
 * Triple doublequotes: `"""inside"""`
 * Inline html: `%>inside<%`
 * Parenthesis: `(inside)`
 * Square brackets: `[inside]`
 
== Indentation / Whitespace ==
Before lexing all lines ending with a single `\` should have the next line
appended to it.

The following keywords forces an indentation on the following line. The use 
thereafter of `:` in the same line cancels that indentation.

 * if
 * else
 * elif
 * for
 * switch
 * case
 * default
 * fn
 * class
 * con / pub / pro / pri / sta
 * while

Some keywords are more special and _can_ trigger an indentation.

 * ??
 * ?!
 
Whitespace works differently when inside `()` or `[]`.
