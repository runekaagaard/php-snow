The use of % as a magic variable [7]. 
        90% 
        My view: 
                I like it but I would like to change <% snowcode %> to <? snowcode ?> to 
                avoid any future problems with %>3 and 3<%<10. 
        Todo: 
                We need to agree on this and write the documentation.

        Todo: 
                Should be discussed at [10], a decision should be made and documentation 
                should be written. 
Import keyword [12] 
        60% 
        My view: 
                I like but its going to have an entry in the "Project settings file" 
                because each project have different ways of including files. 
        Todo: 
                We need to agree on this and write the documentation.

        0% 
        Should we have a file with compiler settings specific to the project?

                I think so.

Functions with inner functions [15] 
        99% 
        My view: 
                This is partially solved with lambda functions in 5.3 so drop it. 
        Todo: 
                We should agree on dropping this feature.
