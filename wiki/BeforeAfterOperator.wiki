#summary Applying stuff before and after a loop inside the loop itself

== Introduction ==
_The following uses `|` instead of `%` as the before-after operator because
I'm considering switching those two._

The reasoning behind the before-after is to try to improve the following
pattern:
{{{
@array lines
def somefunc
    rows = [get_one(), get_other()]
    for line in lines
        rows[] = 42
        rows[] = line
    rows[] = get_third()
    rows[] = get_fourth()
    <- rows
}}}

Using the before-after operator that would read:
{{{
@array arr
def somefunc
    rows = []
    for line in arr
        <- rows[] = get_one() get_other() | 42 line | get_third() get_fourth()
}}}

== Matrix ==
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Snow</strong></td>
        <td><strong>PHP</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Second headline</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Second headline</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Single line</td>
        <td>Single line</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
{{{
Multi-
line
}}}
        </td>
        <td>
{{{
Multi-
line
}}}
        </td>
    </tr>
