== What is Snow? ==
Snow is a language that compiles to PHP or for those familiar with 
[http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ Coffescript] you could say that
Snow is to PHP what Coffeescript is to Javascript.

The main objectives of Snow are:
 * De-uglify PHP's syntax.
 * Create a language with greater expressive power.
 * Save keystrokes and lines.
 * Make PHP fun again.

How did we go about doing that? We looked at several languages we found 
interesting. Most notably: [http://www.python.org/ Python], 
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ Ruby], [http://www.scala-lang.org/ Scala] and 
[http://golang.org/ Go]. We took bits and pieces of each them, threw in some
of our own inventions and created a language that we like much better than PHP.
