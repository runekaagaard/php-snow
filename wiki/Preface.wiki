So, what exactly _is_ Snow? How does it work? And why do I need it?

== What Snow is ==
Snow is a language that compiles to PHP or for those familiar with 
[http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ Coffescript] you could say that
Snow is to PHP what Coffeescript is to Javascript.

The main objectives designing Snow are:
 * De-ugly-fy PHP's syntax
 * Create a syntax that allows for greater expressive power
 * Create a syntax that is more concise

How did we go about doing that? We looked at several languages we deemed 
interesting. Most notably: [http://www.python.org/ Python], 
[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ Ruby], [http://www.scala-lang.org/ Scala] and 
[http://golang.org/ Go]. We took bits and pieces of each them, threw in some
of our own inventions and created a syntax that we like way better than PHP.

The best part of using Snow is that it still fits in the PHP paradigm, 
the complete PHP landscape is still applicable (think serverstack, 
documentation, community etc.), there is just one thin layer added which is the 
Snow compiler.

== Why we have created Snow ==
We have created Snow because PHP's syntax is ugly and it makes our eyes bleed. 
Sure, the language itself is fine; it has a very gradual learning curve 
while still allowing for serious webdevelopment.
