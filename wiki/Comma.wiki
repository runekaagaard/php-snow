#summary The use of the comma character - or lack thereof.

The normal use of the comma as a separator in array definitions and function / method calls and definitions is disabled:
{{{
# Array definition.
a = [1 2 3]
# Object definition.
a = {a:1 b:2 c:3}
# Function call.
b = foo(1 bar() 3)
# Function / Method definition.
fn foo (x y z)
# Multiple connotations on a single line. 
@get @set
# Multiple variable assignment.
a b = 3 4
}}}

Instead the comma character replaces "." as a string concatenator.
{{{
a = "foo" , "bar"
echo a
}}}
Output:
{{{
foobar
}}}
