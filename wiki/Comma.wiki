#summary The use of the comma character - or lack thereof.

The normal use of the comma as a separator in array definitions and function / 
method calls and definitions should be omitted unless in cases where it 
improves readability. Comma must be used or omitted consistently throughout the
entire construct.

Example:
{{{
# Array definition.
a = [1 2 3]
a = [1,2, 3]
a = [
    'foo': 'bar',
    'baz': 'boz',
    [1:2, 3:4, [1 2 3]]
]
# Function call.
b = foo(1 bar() 3)
b = foo(1, bar(), 3)
# Function / Method definition.
fn foo (x y z)
fn foo (x, y, z)
# Multiple variable assignment.
a b = 3 4
a, b = 3, 4
}}}

Invalid example:
{{{
myvar = myfunc('foo' 3, true) # Comma not used or omitted consistently.
}}}
